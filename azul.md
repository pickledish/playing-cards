# Azul with Playing Cards

## Requirements

- A standard 52-card deck of playing cards
- A working knowledge of Azul rules ([link to rulebook PDF](https://www.planbgames.com/en/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=9))

## Concept

The game Azul centers around a group of 100 resin pieces called _tiles_, of which there are five colors (20 of each color). To emulate something similar with a standard deck of cards, we'll **ignore the ranks of the cards, and consider each suit to be a different tile color**. Beause there are only 4 suits, as opposed to the 5 colors of tiles in Azul, we need to make a couple of numeric changes (for example, using a 4x4 tile wall instead of 5x5). However, these changes are small and don't have much effect on the overall gameplay.

## Setup

Remove the jokers from the deck and set them aside. Then, shuffle the deck.

Make sure that each player has a good amount of flat space in front of them -- a rectangle of about 2 feet wide by 1 foot tall per player should be fine. This space is where the player will place the cards (representing tiles) into their pattern lines and tile walls, and the layout of where cards should be placed is like this:

```
                                                    +
                                    PATTERN LINES   |     TILE WALL
                                                    |
                                               +-+  |  +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
                                               | |  |  | | | | | | | |
                                               +-+  |  +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
                                           +-+ +-+  |  +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
                                           | | | |  |  | | | | | | | |
                                           +-+ +-+  |  +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
                                       +-+ +-+ +-+  |  +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
                                       | | | | | |  |  | | | | | | | |
                                       +-+ +-+ +-+  |  +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
                                   +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+  |  +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
                                   | | | | | | | |  |  | | | | | | | |
                                   +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+  |  +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
                                                    |
                                                    +
```

Place one joker in the middle of the play area, centered among all players, then deal `X` piles of 3 cards each in a circle around this joker. The number of piles to make (`X`) is the same as in the normal Azul rules:

  - 5 piles if there are 2 players
  - 7 piles if there are 3 players
  - 9 piles if there are 4 players

This joker in the middle is the `1` tile for the player who goes first, and the `X` piles are the factory displays.

## Play

Using the above substitutions, play the game of Azul as normal (following the rulebook). The players will go in order, selecting tile colors (card suits) from the piles until no tiles remain, then proceed to the second phase where all complete pattern lines will create a new tile on the wall, then repeat. Scoring, which is usually taken care of on the game board, can be noted with tallies on a piece of paper or a phone, which works just as well.

## Winning

Again, this is according to normal Azul rules -- the game ends when one player has filled up a complete row on the tile wall (with no repeated tile colors), and at that point the player with the highest score wins!
