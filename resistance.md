# The Resistance with Playing Cards

## Requirements

- A standard 52-card deck of playing cards
- A working knowledge of The Resistance rules ([link to rulebook PDF](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1XedGicQYS.pdf))

## Concept

The game Resistance revolves mostly around communication between players, with the board game's cards only serving to represent team memberships and player votes. This makes it a good candidate for using playing cards!

Using the deck of playing cards, we'll use the **black cards** to represent the Resistance (the good guys), and the **red cards** to represent the spies (the bad guys), just like in the real game. Similarly, black and red cards will be used during voting to indicate success or failure of a mission.

## Setup

Remove the jokers from the deck and set them aside.

Then, remove all the face cards from the deck, and place into a pile some black and red face cards corresponding to how many people are playing the game. Then, shuffle that pile and give one face-down to each player. These cards represent the player cards, which determines which side each player is on, and will be kept secret throughout the game. The table to determine how many of each black and red face cards is (copied from the rules) is provided below:

|**Players**|Five|Six|Seven|Eight|Nine|Ten|
|-------|----|---|-----|-----|----|---|
|**Resistance (black)**|3|4|4|5|6|6|
|**Spies (red)**|2|2|3|3|3|4|

For example, if we're playing with 8 players, we'd put 5 black face cards and 3 red ones into the pile, then shuffle, and distribute one face-down to each player.

Then, the leader
