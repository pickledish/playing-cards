# The Resistance with Playing Cards

## Requirements

- A standard 52-card deck of playing cards
- A working knowledge of The Resistance rules ([link to rulebook PDF](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1XedGicQYS.pdf))

## Concept

The game Resistance revolves mostly around communication between players, with the board game's cards only serving to represent team memberships and player votes. This makes it a good candidate for using playing cards!

Using the deck of playing cards, we'll use the **black cards** to represent the Resistance (the good guys), and the **red cards** to represent the spies (the bad guys), just like in the real game. Similarly, black and red cards will be used during voting to indicate success or failure of a mission.

## Setup

Remove the jokers from the deck and set them aside.

Then, remove all the face cards from the deck, and place into a pile some black and red face cards corresponding to how many people are playing the game. Then, shuffle that pile and give one face-down to each player. These cards represent the player cards, which determines which side each player is on, and will be kept secret throughout the game. The table to determine how many of each black and red face cards to use (copied from the rules) is provided below:

|**Players**|Five|Six|Sevn|Eight|Nine|Ten|
|-----------|----|---|----|-----|----|---|
|**Resistance (black)**|3|4|4|5|6|6|
|**Spies (red)**|2|2|3|3|3|4|

For example, if we're playing with 8 players, we'd put 5 black face cards and 3 red ones into the pile, then shuffle, and distribute one face-down to each player.

Then, the leader commands the spies to secretly reveal themselves to each other (as normal), and the game starts.

## Play

Play continues just as it would in the normal game:

- Use the :thumbsup:/:thumbsdown: method (i.e. people just voting with their hands) for determining whether a player's suggested team is majority approved or rejected to go on the mission
- Use the non-face cards of the deck as the support/saborage cards, which players on a mission submit in secret to determine if the mission is successful

A piece of paper with tallies (or a phone) should be used to keep track of which mission the team is on, and which of the past missions were successes or failures. Make sure it's public and easy to view by everyone playing, just like in the normal game. The table used to determine how many people need to go on each mission (copied from the rules) is provided below:

|**Players**|Five|Six|Sevn|Eight|Nine|Ten|
|-----------|----|---|----|-----|----|---|
|**Mission #1**|2|2|2|3|3|3|
|**Mission #2**|3|3|3|4|4|4|
|**Mission #3**|2|4|3|4|4|4|
|**Mission #4**|3|3|4|5|5|5|
|**Mission #5**|3|4|4|5|5|5|

> From the rules: The 4th Mission in games of 7+ players requires at least two failure cards to be a failed mission.
