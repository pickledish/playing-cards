# Board Games with Playing Cards

How to play some "real" board games with a standard 52-card deck!

Note: The rule files in this repository are meant for people who are already mostly familiar with the original games. If you haven't played the game before, it's necessary to read the rules for that specific game first (I link to the official rulebook in each file), then return here once you've got the gist!

See the individual `game.md` files in this repository to view the rules for any individual game.

## Contributing

PRs for new games are gladly accepted! Just try to make sure to keep as close to the original game as possible.
