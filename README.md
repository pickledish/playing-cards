# Board Games with Playing Cards

How to play some "real" board games with a standard 52-card deck!

**Important Note**: The rule files in this repository are meant for people who are already mostly familiar with the original games. If you haven't played the game before, it's necessary to read the rules for that specific game first (I link to the official rulebook in each file), then return here once you've got the gist!

## Games

The current list of converted games is as follows (more always appreciated, see [Contributing](https://github.com/pickledish/playing-cards#contributing)):

- [Azul](./azul.md)
- [The Resistance](./resistance.md)

As a side note, all of these games are excellent. Assuming you aren't going camping or trying to see how few material possessions you can get away with, I highly recommend purchasing "real" copies of them :slightly_smiling_face:

## Contributing

PRs for new games are gladly accepted! Just try to make sure to keep as close to the original game as possible.
